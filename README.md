# Plant Disease Image Classification(CNN) Project.

# Description
This project is focused on the classification of plant diseases using images, leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The aim is to identify various diseases affecting plant leaves, thereby assisting in the early intervention and management of plant health. By utilizing CNNs, the system efficiently categorizes images of plant leaves into different classes based on the type of disease present. A key feature of the project is its high accuracy in detecting and classifying diseases. The model is trained and validated on publicly available datasets, ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world applications. Furthermore, real-time predictions and a user-friendly interface are made possible through the deployment of the model in a web application, enabling users such as farmers and agricultural professionals to upload leaf images and receive instant diagnostic feedback. This project not only aids in disease detection but also contributes to improving agricultural practices by minimizing crop losses and enhancing crop yield through timely disease management.

### Model Architecture

   1. **Input Shape** : 
   Our models input shape is defined as (BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, CHANNELS). This means that the model expects input images to be of a specific size (we have taken our Image size as 128x128 pixels) and have a specific number of color channels (as our dataset contain color images we have taken channel as 3 as it represented as RGB image). The batch size determines the number of images that will be processed simultaneously during training and inference (Our Batch size is 16).
       
      input_shape = (BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, CHANNELS)
   2. **Number of Classes** : 
   We have created variable named as 'num_classes' which is set to 15, indicating that the model is designed to classify the input images into 15 different classes, likely representing different plant diseases or a healthy class.
       
      num_classes = 15

   3. **Moderl Architecture** : 
   - Resize and Rescale: The first layer is a custom layer called resize_and_rescale, which likely performs image preprocessing tasks such as resizing the input images to the required size (i.e. 128x128 pixels) and normalizing the pixel values(by dividing each image by 255).

         model = Sequential([
         resize_and_rescale,
         

   - Data Augmentation: The second layer is a data augmentation layer, which applies various transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping) to the input images during training to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization.

          data_augmentation,

   - Convolutional Layers: The model consists of 3 sets of convolutional layers, each followed by a max-pooling layer. The convolutional layers extract relevant features from the input images, while the max-pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, helping to make the model more robust to spatial variations.

          # Input layer and first Hidden layer
          layers.Conv2D(32, kernel_size = (3, 3), activation = 'relu', input_shape = input_shape),
          layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
          # Second Hidden layer
          layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size = (3, 3), activation = 'relu'),
          layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
          # Third Hidden layer
          layers.Conv2D(64, kernel_size = (3, 3), activation = 'relu'),
          layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

   - Flatten Layers: 
     After the convolutional and max-pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a 1D vector, which is then passed to the fully connected layers.

          # Fourth Hidden layer
          layers.Flatten(),

  - Fully Connected Layers: The model has two fully connected (dense) layers. The first dense layer has 64 units and uses the 'ReLU' activation function, while the second dense layer has num_classes units (i.e. 15) and uses the 'softmax' activation function to produce the final classification probabilities.

         # Fifth Hidden layer
         layers.Dense(64, activation = 'relu'),
         # Output layer
         layers.Dense(num_classes, activation = 'softmax')
         ])


 4. **Model Building** : 
 The model.build() function is called with the specified input shape, which initializes the model's weights and prepares it for training.
         
    model.build(input_shape = input_shape)


5. **Model Compilation** : 
      
       model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

The model.compile() function is used to configure the training process of the model. The combination of the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric is a common and effective choice for training a multi-class image classification model like the one presented in the given architecture. 

The model.compile() function sets up the training process by:
 
    1. Specifying the optimization algorithm (Adam) to be used for updating the model's weights during training.

    2. Defining the loss function (sparse categorical cross-entropy) to be minimized during the training process.

    3. Selecting the performance metric (accuracy) to be monitored and reported during training and validation.

  
  - Optimizer: The optimizer is set to 'adam', which is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. The Adam optimizer is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of momentum and RMSProp, making it well-suited for a wide range of machine learning problems, including image classification.

  - Loss Function: The loss function is set to 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy'. This loss function is used for multi-class classification problems, where the target labels are integers representing the class indices. The "sparse" in the name indicates that the target labels are not one-hot encoded, but rather represented as integer values. This is a common choice for classification tasks with a large number of classes, as it can be more efficient than using one-hot encoding.

  - Metrics: The 'accuracy' metric is specified, which will be used to evaluate the model's performance during training and validation. The accuracy metric calculates the fraction of correctly classified samples, providing a straightforward way to assess the model's classification performance.
